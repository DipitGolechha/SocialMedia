# SocialMedia
Hello coders, I made a social media using the help of two bootstrap themes so the css is 90% of my bootstrap themes ( i have license for using it ), I changed the themes a bit and i combined them and converted them into php so i thought of sharing it.

I will add a screenshot of the mysql tables which i made for the website
The tables name need to be same or you will need to edit the code
there is no connection of database made so u need to add ur own database remeber that.
